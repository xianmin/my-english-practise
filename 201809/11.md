Yesterday, I did not write an essay. Because I didn't get up early. For me, the best writing time is in the morning. I need to work during the day. At night, if there are friends, maybe I need to accompany them and drinking with them. Then there is no time to write something. So I have to get up early.

In the morning, when the sun just rises, everything is very quiet. No one will bother you. This time is more suitable for concerntration. Concerntrate on writing an essay. After this, washing and have breakfast. Then start the day's work.

A Chinese proverb says, An hour in the morning is worth two in the evening. (一日之计在于晨)
