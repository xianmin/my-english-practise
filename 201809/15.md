There is a story in the novel: An intern who is about to get a very good job, when he went to Egypt for a vacation, suddenly felt impulsive to settle here, and he did, and gave up his good life in the UK. Then he lived a quiet and poor life in Alexandria for the rest of his life. Many years later, "I" met another doctor who replaced this person to get this job. Now the latter is already a Jazz. He laughs at the former as "destroying himself" and "lack of personality." And "I" think that the measure of the success is only in everyone's heart.

Life, need six pence, but also don't forget the moon.

P.S. This is a diary I have written before. I translated it into English. Remind myself, don't forget the moon.
