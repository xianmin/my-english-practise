The earphones I currently use are from Mr Ocean. Last month, he gave it to me. Ocean is my older brother. We met each other 5 years ago. I think knowing him is a bad thing.

Ocean is more than 40 years old. But he has nothing. He can play guitar and was a member of a band many years ago. Even so, most of common people don't enjoy his music. Because his basic music training is not good. But he always need to show off. I think he needs to be the center of attention. These are nothing. But if you tell him that he is not good, he will go crazy. He always makes trouble for his friends, because he drinks a lot. trying to be a friend to him, I tell him many times, "You can't do it like this." It doesn't help. I am very disappointed.

I know that he is in a lot of pain. This is life, nothing could be done quickly. He taught me how not to live.
