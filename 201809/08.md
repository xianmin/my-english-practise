The earphone I use now is come from Mr Ocean. Last month, he give it to me. Ocean is my older brother. We know each other 5 years ago. I think it's a bad thing that I know him.

Ocean is more than 40 years old. But he has nothing. He could play guitar and is a member of the band many years ago. Even so, most of common people can't enjoy his music. Because his basic music training is not good. But he always need to show himself. I think he need sence of existence. These are nothing. But if you tell him, he is not good, he will crazy. He always make trouble for his friends, because of he drink a lot. Be a friend of him, I tell him many times, you can't do it like this. No help. I am very disappoint.

I know, he is very painful. This is life, nothing could be done quickly. He taught me a lot in the opposite direction.
