Mr Yuan's family stayed in our hostel for half a month in August. He has an 8-years-old daughter named Ximi. Ximi was in school for a semester. Her parents think that there was a problem with the school's education program, so they started homeschooling her.

This year, they traveled around China, learning on the road. The family is very friendly and I feel very happy with them. Mr Yuan is a very knowledgeable lawyer, and he has read a lot of books. We talked about various topics - education, economics, politics, etc. Talking with him brings me a lot of inspiration.

Ximi is a smart and sensible girl. She likes the dogs at our hostel and plays with them everyday. She seems to be more mature than other children her age. I am not sure if this is good or bad. But anyway, I still admire her. She has gone to so many places at this age.
