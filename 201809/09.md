Mr Yuan's family stayed in our hostel for half a month in August. He has a daughter named Ximi, 8 years old. Ximi was in school for a semester. Her parents think that there was a problem with the school's education. Than they took her home to educate themselves.

This year, they go out and travel around China, learning on the road. The family is very friendly and I feel very happy with them. Mr Yuan is a very knowledgeable lawyer, and he read a lot of books. We talked about various topics, education, economic, political, etc. Talking with him brings me a lot of inspiration.

Ximi is a smart and sensible girl. She likes the dog at our hostel, and play with them everyday. She seems to be more mature than her peers. I am not sure if this is good or bad. But anyway, I still admire her, she went so many places at this age.
