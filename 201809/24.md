Today is Chinese Mid-Autumn festival. Usually, at this day, we will eat the moon cakes. But today, we make dumplings together in the hostel. There are two ladies very good at making dumplings. They made very delicious stuffing. We had a very delicious lunch.

A Chinese poetry said, "All alone in a foreign land, I am twice as homesick on this day." (独在异乡为异客，每逢佳节倍思亲。)

I called my family at night. They are all good. I am too far away from them. 


People experience sorrow, joy, separation and reunion, 
The moon may be dim or bright, round or crescent shaped, 
This imperfection has been going on since the beginning of time. 
May we all be blessed with longevity, 
Though thousands of miles apart, we are still able to share the beauty of the moon together.
