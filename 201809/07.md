Mr Zhong is a true Chinese Kungfu master. He came to our hostel with his disciple. His disciple is my friend's classmate before. So we have the opportunity to meet each other.

In China, there are many fake Kungfu master. Their Kungfu just for show, or defrauding the money of others. Most common people have no chance to meet the true Kungfu master. It's my honor and lucky to meet Mr Zhong. In my life, this is the first time to watch real Chinese Kungfu.

He found another strong friend to show. Fast move and accurate hit. Any attack has a different way to fight back. These skills is come from traditional. One teaches one to be handed down. Mr Zhong tell us, he put apprentices from 7 years old, a lot of suffering and day after day practice. Then there is such a level today.

Any ability is not easy to accomplish.
