That day, I was having tea with my friend in the hall. A guest said goodbye to me and left a book for the hostel, for other guests to read. This book is "The Moon and Sixpence". 

I have heard this book very early. The electric version of it has been on my computer hard drive and almost forgotten by me. I took the book at the time and put it on the table. The next day, I picked up it and looked through it. I didn't expect that to be attracted at once.

I read it all at once. Somehow, I am reminded of some people who met in Yunnan and Tibet, who resigned and traveled away from home, looking for meaning of life and purifying the soul. I don't know if they have read this book?
