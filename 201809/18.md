When I was 13 years old, I left home alone for two months. That is my unforgettable memory. At that time, I was in second grade of Junior High School. I was addicted to online gaming, and my parents have taught me again and again, but I can't quit it. Then my mother beat me, I left home without any money.

Two months later, my parents found me in another town and took me home. I am ashamed to continue my studies at the original school. Then I went back to the poor rural hometown. Everything has changed, there is no computer in my hometown. I can't play the online game, I changed.
