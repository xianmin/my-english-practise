From today, I want to challenge myself. Let me get something straight: This month, I will try to write an essay everyday, at least 150 words every essay. This challenge maybe difficult for me. But I want to give it a try.

At the beginning of this year, in my diary, I write I want improve my English this year. But half a year has passed. My English ability don't have any improvement. Why? Practise is too less. I should do more deliberate practice. Writing in English is a good choice.

I am a hostel manager. I have many works to do everyday. But these things are not excuses. I could get up half hour early for writing. Many things are worth recording, interesting things happening, my new idea, a story of something, a story of somebody, etc. Talk is easy, just write them down.

A Chinese proverb says, "Achievements are reached by hard work rather than recreation. Actions are done after thorough consideration rather than casual decision."
