I have a dog named Kaka. He is a male dog. Two days ago, he went outside in the night, and didn't come back all night. In the morning on the next day, I found him in a field. He was with another dog, I guess the other dog is female. They must have done something unspeakable.

I took Kaka home. He was very dirty. I gave him a bath. Then I tied him and I told him, "You can't go anywhere from now on." He was lying on the ground with a sad expression.

For the past two days, Kaka has been very quiet and hasn't eaten any food. He looks listless. Maybe he is missing the female dog all the time. Maybe he is missing that beautiful night. Oh, this is love, such fantastic love!
