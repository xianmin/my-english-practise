I have a dog named Kaka. He is a male dog. Two days ago, he went outside in the night, and didn't come back all night. The next day morning, I found him in a field. He was with another dog, I guess the another dog is female. They must did something unspeakable.

I took Kaka home. He was very dirty. I took a shower for him. Than I tied him and I told him, "You can't go anywhere from now on." He was lying on the ground with a sad expression.

These two days, Kaka is very quiet and doesn't eat any food. He looks listless. Maybe he is missing the female dog all the time. Maybe he is missing that beautiful night. Oh, this is love, such fantastic love!
