I often have a desire to express my thought, but I donâ€™t like to chat with people most of the time, then the text becomes a good way to express. If it is not expressed, several thoughts collide in the mind, which is really distracting.

My thoughts are confusing and there is no clear thread. This is the reason why I have been distressed for a long time.
