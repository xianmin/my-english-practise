I often have a desire to express my thoughts, but I donâ€™t like to chat with people most of the time, so writing becomes a good alternative. If I repress myself, my mind will have a lot of internal conflict, which is distracting.

My thoughts are confusing, and there is no clear thread. This is the reason why I have been distressed for a long time.
