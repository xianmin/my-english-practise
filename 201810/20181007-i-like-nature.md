I like nature.

October 4, I organized an activity: hiking to Wen Lake. Wen Lake is on the other side of the mountain. Almost 9 kilometers. It's not very far, but you need to climb over a mountain. And here is the plateau, need to spend more physical strength.

Very lucky, it's a sunny day. We were leaving at 10 o'colock. Through the village, through the fields, through the woods, we walked into the nature. Kaka was very happy, he was running around us. When we arrived at the Wen Lake, Kaka jumped directly into the water, gave himself a bath.
